# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a Prework Study Guide Webpage that contains information and tips on the topics that are covered within the bootcamp. This was created for bootcamp students to refer to so that they can look back and revise nay thing that has been learnt in the bootcamp so far. It is also used as a way to organise and manage the information that is recieved for every lesson of the bootcamp. Working on this project helped introduce me to using HTML, CSS, GIT, JavaScript and using Markdown files for formatting.
